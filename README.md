# SchemeLand

SchemeLand is a application developed using flutter an initiative for developing the rular peoples

# Description
There are hundreds of Government schemes in India for various meant. But how many people are aware of it? How many are taking advantage of it? Almost 50% of the people are not getting actual access to these schemes because they are not able to access the different web portals made for it. It is difficult to go by one by one and then looking for their purpose. So we have a solution, we will be making a smart web portal that will be a mixture of all gov. schemes with a comprehensive user interface. There will different sections for students, employees, workers, etc. for students scholarships etc. It will be Time saving and easy to access all the things in a single portal. Students will get different learning resources online. Also, we will give a feature for suggestions and complaints as their feedback. In technologies, we will be using Frontend and Backend web technologies. We want to contribute to the field of Rural/Urban Development and want to help people by providing them all the facilities of the gov. schemes so that they can get the advantage of these types of beneficial schemes.
